# Twitterbot
A very SIMPLE bot that tracks use of specific hashtags and whatnot

This bot uses the Python library Tweepy to access the Twitter API, so we need to first install it.

sudo pip install --upgrade pip

You might not need to do this but I had to upgrade to the latest version of pip when trying to install it.

sudo pip install tweepy

Now you're all set to use the python script, you can run it with:

sudo python tweet.py

If it doesn't run, you might need to install python;

sudo apt-get install python

This command should do the trick

Here is how I wired it. Disclaimer, I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing, so I just googled for a while and found this. I also used 1k resistor for each LED.
